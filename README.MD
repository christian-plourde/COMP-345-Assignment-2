WARNING
---------------------------------------
If attempting to run this code in Visual Studio or Eclipse, you may encounter an error with the inclusion of file "dirent.h".
This is because this file is not included in the C++ compiler with these IDE.
To fix this with Visual Studio, dirent.h (included with this code) needs to be placed in Visual Studio's Include folder.
This can typically be found in 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.15.26726\include



Part 1 & 2: Game Start and Startup Phase
----------------------------------------

The game setup can be tested by running the executable called main.exe, found in the driver folder. It can also be recompiled by compiling the main.cpp file in the same folder, which contains the main method for this driver.

Part 3: Main Game Loop
---------------------------------------
The main game loop can be tested by running main.cpp, found in the driver folder.

Part 4, 5, & 6: Player Specific Methods
---------------------------------------

The player methods such as move, buy cards, roll dice, and resolve dice, can be viewed by running the executable file called playertest.exe. This can also be recompiled by compiling the file playertest.cpp, which is where the main method is found.
