Part 1 & 2: Game Start and Startup Phase
----------------------------------------

The game setup can be tested by running the executable called main.exe, found in the driver folder. It can also be recompiled by compiling the main.cpp file in the same folder, which contains the main method for this driver.

Part 4, 5, & 6: Player Specific Methods
---------------------------------------

The player methods such as move, buy cards, roll dice, and resolve dice, can be viewed by running the executable file called playertest.exe. This can also be recompiled by compiling the file playertest.cpp, which is where the main method is found.
